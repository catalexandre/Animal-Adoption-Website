# Animal-Adoption-Website
A school project that was to be done over the course of the semester. Keep in mind that the whole project is unfinished and unpolished, and is on my github for the sake of presenting my different projects.

## How to access the website
1. Download the project files
2. Run the server (can use Visual Studio Code for this)
3. Go to the site's URL (If you run it on your local machine, access "localhost:5342")
